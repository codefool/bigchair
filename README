Creating Objects
mk [from] prototype [as] [bag. ...]name [[bag. ...]name]

mk from #.Phaser1 as Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser1-1
mk from #.Phaser2 as Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser2-1
mk from #.Phaser2 as Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser2-2
mk #.Phaser3 Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser3-1
mk #.Phaser3 Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser3-2
mk #.Phaser3 Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser3-3
mk #.Phaser3 Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection.Phaser3-4

Create a prototype Object and copy it multiple times
mktmp Catalog.Phaser1 #.Phaser1
with #.Phaser1
.facing = ABCDEF
.range = 20

with Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection
cp #.phaser1 .phaser1-1
cp #.phaser2 .phaser2-1 .phaser2-2
cp #.phaser3 .phaser3-1 .phaser3-2 .phaser3-3

Set the focus to a particular bag:
with Enterprise.PrimaryHull.ForwardSection
mk Catalog.Phaser1 as .Phaser1-1
mk Catalog.Phaser2 as .Phaser2-1 .Phaser2-2
mk Catalog.Phaser3 as .Phaser3-1 .Phaser3-2 .Phaser3-3

Linking Objects
- Objects with unique names can be referenced directly
- Objects which are conduits 
- Objects have ports that are either input, output, or both.
- Ports can have a type, as in "power in" or "data out"
- So a "data out" port from a sensor array can be linked to a "data in" to the library computer.

with Enterprise
ln .Battery1-1 .Conduit1 .phaser1-1
ln .BAT1-1 .COND1-1 .PH1-1

Unlink a connection:
un .BAT1-1

Deleteing Objects
rm Object [Object ..]

Listing Objects

Referencing Objects
- If Object is a bag, support dot notation
- Object.Object.Object.Object
